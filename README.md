Because I can and because why not, I bring you this neat little mod I'm using in a private modpack I'm creating. Special thanks to Galaxtone and d4rsorc for all their amazing help in redoing this mod from the ground up!

This mod will be 1.12.2 only, I have no plans on back porting. If anyone wishes to back port this mod, feel free to do a GitHub fork of it and share it with me, I'll gladly upload it and make sure all credits go to you.

This mod REQUIRES Electroblob's Wizardry (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/electroblobs-wizardry)
